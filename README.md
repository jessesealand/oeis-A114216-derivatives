(OEIS) Numbers n such that A114216(n)=m.

## About

This series is recursively generated, meaning to generate any new term, the prior term must be known. This project serves two purposes:
* Retain known data to create repository for future progress, without recalculating prior work
* Simultaneously progress on all possible sequences which are based on this data.

## Progress

I am in the process of recalculating A114216 up to the noted limit of (4 * 10^9) that Donovan Johnson previously investigated. I will provide updates semi-regularly until we reach this point.

    Completed:  7.75% (310,000,000 / 4,000,000,000â€¬)
