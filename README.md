## About

This series is recursively generated, meaning to generate any new term, the prior term must be known. This project serves two purposes:
* Retain known data to create repository for future progress, without recalculating prior work
* Simultaneously progress on all possible sequences which are based on this data.

## Derivative Sequences
Numbers n such that A114216(n)=k:
